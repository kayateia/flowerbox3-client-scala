# Flowerbox Client

This is the client for Flowerbox 3, aka the voxel version. Running this requires
a working Scala environment (sbt), a supported LWJGL platform, and a few
textures that you currently have to supply for yourself.

THIS IS NOW DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF THE KOTLIN REPO. Please see flowerbox3-client on
this GitHub account for everything moving forward.
